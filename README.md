# oneAPI Video Processing Library

The oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) provides a single video processing
API for encode, decode, and video processing that works across a wide range of
accelerators.

This repository contains the API, dispatcher, and a CPU reference implementation
of the specification.

## Building

### Configure the build environment

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for instructions on installing build prerequisites


### Build dependencies and oneVPL (default, no GPL)

Ubuntu bash shell:
```
script/bootstrap
script/build
```

You can find the build output in `_build`.

Windows cmd or powershell prompt:
```
script\bootstrap
script\build
```

Note: while msys2 shell is installed for initial configuration it is not
supported for this step.

You can find the build output in `_build\Release`.

### Optionally enable h264 encode

Add `gpl` to the above build lines to enable h264 encode capability. Note that
the GPL license will apply to the build output in this case.

```
bootstrap gpl
build gpl
```

### Run the examples

Ubuntu bash shell:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/_build
_build/hello-decode test/content/cars_128x96.h265
_build/hello-encode test/content/cars_128x96.i420 128 96
_build/hello-vpp test/content/cars_128x96.i420 128 96
```

Windows cmd prompt:
```
_build\Release\hello-decode test\content\cars_128x96.h265
_build\Release\hello-encode test\content\cars_128x96.i420 128 96
_build\Release\hello-vpp test\content\cars_128x96.i420 128 96
```
Note: while msys2 shell is installed for initial configuration it is not
supported for this step.
